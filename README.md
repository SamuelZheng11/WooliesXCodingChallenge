# WooliesXCodingChallenge
Store the back-end for the WooliesX coding challenge

## Logging and Tests
Currenty this project does not have logging or unit/integration tests, Given more time I would like to have performed TDD and introduced different levels of logging but due to the time contraints I am under I was not able to do this

## Token and URL storage
Under normal circumstances I would have stored the resource URL under something like AppSettings.json and pull it from there, Like wise with my token on Azure KeyVault. However Due to time constraints and current issues connecting to the KeyVault, I have stored them in the repository
